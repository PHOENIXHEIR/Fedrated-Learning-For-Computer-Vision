# Federated Learning for Computer Vision

This repository, maintained by [PHOENIXHEIR](https://github.com/PHOENIXHEIR), provides a comprehensive overview and implementation of Federated Learning (FL) techniques applied to various Computer Vision (CV) tasks. The goal is to facilitate privacy-preserving model training across decentralized devices while addressing challenges such as data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and security.

## Overview

Federated Learning enables training machine learning models on edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices) without transferring raw data to a central server, thus ensuring privacy. This approach is particularly beneficial in Computer Vision, where large datasets are required, and data privacy concerns are significant.

### Key Features
- **Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL)**: Training across devices with similar feature spaces.
- **Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)**: Training on datasets with different features across the same samples.
- **Federated Transfer Learning (FTL)**: Collaboration between datasets with limited feature and sample overlap.
- **Aggregation Techniques**: Implementation of techniques like FedAvg, Progressive Fourier Aggregation, and FedGKT.
- **Privacy Preservation**: Methods including Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), Differential Privacy, and Homomorphic Encryption.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensuring secure data sharing and model aggregation.

## Applications

Federated Learning is used in various Computer Vision tasks:
- **Object Detection**: Identifying objects in images while maintaining data privacy.
- **Medical Imaging**: Collaborating across healthcare institutions for enhanced diagnostic models without sharing patient data.
- **Autonomous Driving**: Improving vehicle perception models using decentralized data from multiple vehicles.
- **Video Surveillance**: Enabling smart, privacy-aware monitoring systems.
